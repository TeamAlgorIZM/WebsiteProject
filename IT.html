			<div class="aboutUs">
				<p>I am Ibrahim Taghizade, 17 years old competitive programmer. I born in Tovuz, grew up in Baku. My poor memory and concentration created many difficulties for me; however my interest in math led me to successful academic life. Participating in some math competitions, I understood that it is not for me. Then I met with programming in 9th grade. From that time on I improved myself in this area. Right now I am studying computer science in ADA. The main reason I chose this major is that I love problem solving and computer science is about solving difficult problems and finding solutions to real problems.</p>
